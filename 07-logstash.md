# Logstash

CHSDM have begun to develop millions of log files, stored on a multitude of systems. Log files are typically are stored on the systems that generate them, and CHSDM have many of these systems. Log files are stored on server instances within Amazon Web Services cloud, our data center in Herndon, Vriginia, and locally on PCs and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) computers in numerous locations throughout the museum.
 
In order to better deal with all of these logs, CHSDM have employed an open source system called [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash). Logstash works a conduit which log messages travel through. As systems generate log files, they are sent to Logstash which formats and processes in to a variety of outputs. 

Logstash can be highly customized, allowing CHSDM to store copies of its logs in multiple locations and in multiple formats. At CHSDM logs get processed into text files. Additionally, each log message is formatted into JSON which is then inserted into an [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) index for ease of access and search-ability. This ElasticSearch index is used to create the administration pages illustrated in Diagram 01 and Diagram 02. These administration pages, leveraging the data generated by the logs, have become one of the main diagnostic and analytics tools for the entire system at CHSDM.
