# Further Experimentation

So far, Mode has proven very effective as a tool for visualizing the data stored in the CHSDM Redshift data warehouse. It has plenty of simple to use tools, and if anything, it makes it really easy to export data to a CSV or to Excel. Mode has proven useful as a prototyping and exploration tool. It’s easy to try out new ideas for queries, and see the results in a graph right away. This type of playful experimentation is what usually leads to discovery of more and more insight into the data at CHSDM.

There are of course many other tools CHSDM would like to explore. [Microsoft PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) seems to offer a variety of similar tools and utilities, but CHSDM have yet to figure out how to connect up PowerBI with its Redshift warehouse. Tessitura’s T-Stats is in itself, essentially a data warehouse. It seems a little like swimming upstream to try and imagine a method of getting all of CHSDMs external data into Tessitura, but the one upside would be that it is already stored in Smithsonian's PCI compliant zone.

Mainly, CHSDM staff are really interested in using tools like Mode to prototype and develop queries quickly. Ultimately CHSDM would like to develop code within the same administration areas of its collections website mentioned in the beginning of this report. The idea here would be that CHSDM would have all of its diagnostics and analytics tools and data available in one convenient place. CHSDM staff would be able to have easy access to these administration areas and could carefully control their design and output. So far CHSDM staff have developed simple connection code between its admin areas and Redshift and a few simple report pages, but this work is in its infancy.
