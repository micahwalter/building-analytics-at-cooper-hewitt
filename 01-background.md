# Background

For just about as long as museums have been around, they have been in the business of collecting and storing data. Museums collect data about objects, data about people, and even data about time. One could argue that a museum is in a way a kind of data warehouse.

Initially, museums have focused their efforts on understanding and making accessible their collection meta-data. Today, museum collection meta-data is pretty common, and more recently, museums have begun to take steps to make this meta-data available to the public. 

The publication of this data has allows the public, students, scholars and researchers easy access to the knowledge developed by the museum around its holdings. Building rich collections websites allows this knowledge to be more discoverable, offering new ways of learning.

But collection meta-data is only one aspect of the kind of data one might find in and around a place like a museum. More recently, museums have begun collecting and storing meta-data about, visits to the museum's website, data about ticket sales and attendance at public programs, and even the temperature and humidity inside its galleries.

In parallel to this extensive work to generate and collect the data, there is the notion that there is some sort of underlying knowledge living within. The idea being that if institutions like museums are collecting all of this data, they will one day understand more about the museum, more about their visitors, and eventually be able to be more successful as an institution. 

In 2014, CHSDM reopened to the public after a long period of renovation and redesign. To coincide with the museumâ€™s reopening, CHSDM launched a re-imagined visitor experience, filled with technology and innovation and built from the ground up. One of the more interesting aspects of this new experience (The New Experience) at CHSDM is certainly The Pen. The Pen is an interactive device that is issued to each visitor allowing one to collect the things they find interesting and store them on a personal web-page for retrieval at a later date. 

There have been many writings, reviews, and discussions about The Pen and its implications within the context of a museum. This paper will address the behind the scenes aspects of The Pen, all of the data it and its related system generate and how these sources of data may be used to help the museum begin to ask questions around the behavior of its visitors.
