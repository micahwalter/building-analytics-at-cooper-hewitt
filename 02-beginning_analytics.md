# Beginning Analytics

**Web Traffic Data**

Analytics, is a set of tools & methods which allow one to understand some aspect of a complex data-set. Formally, Analytics is the systematic or computational analysis of data or statistics (Google Definition). It's important to understand that analytics is not data, and data is not analytics.

For a long while, museums have been using tools such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) to better understand the Internet traffic to its website. Internet traffic to a museum’s website can offer insight into its audience and offerings, and can help museum staff to make informed decisions, and develop a strategy for future efforts. Through the use of Google Analytics museums are able to easily understand who is coming to its website, what these web visitors are interested in, and what they might find frustrating or confusing. Overall, Google Analytics is an incredibly powerful tool that has been used for years to uncover just one aspect of a museum’s operations.

One of the more interesting side effects of the use of Google Analytics is that it has raised the expectation about what is possible. The tool itself is very easy to use and after a short tutorial can be prove very enlightening to even the least tech-savvy employee.

**Collection Data**

Another major data-set within a museum is its collection meta-data. This is typically the data stored in collection databases such as [The Museum System](http://www.gallerysystems.com/products-and-services/tms/) (TMS), a powerful collections management tool created by Gallery Systems. These types of databases were originally designed as repositories of information to help a museum store and locate objects in their collections. Collections management systems were originally meant to behave like inventory management applications, allowing a museum to track its vast collections and the movements of all its objects and holdings.

Eventually, collection meta-data became interesting in another way. Museums began to use collection meta-data as a new way of exploring the shape of their collections. While an individual collection record might tell the story of a single object in the collection, the total set of data becomes useful in telling the story of the museum's collection as a whole. 

One of the most popular analytics tools for exploring collection data is the museum's collections website. Museums the world over have gone through great lengths to put their collections online with the usual purpose being to allow easier access for its visitors. The end result is an extensive tool, similar to Google Analytics, which allows anyone to learn about the shape and purpose of a collection by dividing it up into browsable and searchable parts. At CHSDM, this idea of browsability and discovery is at the forefront of the work, often times leading the creative direction across the entire visitor experience.
