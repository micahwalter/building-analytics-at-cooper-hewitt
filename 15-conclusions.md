# Conclusions

Data warehousing can be an effective method for building analytics within an institution. The concept of collecting ALL types of data and putting it in a single place where the institution can have easy and secure access to it seems like the way forward.

Migrating data in and out of the warehouse can be time consuming and inaccurate. Steps need to be taken to ensure the data is mapped between its original source and the warehouse in a way that ensures this accuracy. As well, data sent to the warehouse needs to be securely transfered and stored. The periodic nature of these types of data transfers means that data within the warehouse will always lag behind the real-time data being generated on a daily basis.

Once the data is in the warehouse, its can be easily manipulated, visualized and used to express the answers to many questions. With the warehouse in place, and analytics tools attached, it is possible to prototype visualizations of vast amounts and types of data. This scenario ca have a positive impact on museum staff interested in developing questions around visitor behavior. 

CHSDM staff are embarking on a year long study of its visitors and behavior related to the Pen and interactive experiences within the museum. Using a data warehouse to store results from these types of survey should allow CHSDM staff to better analyze results, pairing the raw data from the study with Pen data, ticketing data and more, eventually providing a clearer picture of the visitor experience from start to finish.
