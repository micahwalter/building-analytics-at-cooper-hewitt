# A System of Parts

CHSDM has developed a complex system of parts and services that make the entire museum experience possible. Nearly every aspect of this complex system generates, collects and stores some kind of data.

The web servers powering www.cooperhewitt.org create log messages for every request, registrars record entries in TMS for every movement of an object, ticketing systems record information about visitors and the tickets they purchase.

The Pen generates data each time a visitor receives one, uses it to collect an object, uses it to create a digital design, uses it to browse their collection at the digital tables and finally when they return it to the visitor services staff. Each system stores this data for safe keeping, and generates log messages to record the events that happen as they unfold. This data is all stored on a long list of servers and systems, each with their own complex configurations and formats.
