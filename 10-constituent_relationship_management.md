# Constituent Relationship Management

Within the Smithsonian Data Center is housed CHSDM's Constituent Relationship Management System, [Tessitura](http://www.tessituranetwork.com). Tessitura is an enterprise-class Microsoft SQL Server based database. Client software is installed on staff member’s desks and at the visitor services stations at the front desk at CHSDM. 

The main purpose of Tessitura is to store data about each and every visitor to CHSDM. This data takes the form of address and contact information, memberships and subscriptions purchased, and tickets purchased for general admission to the museum. 

Tessitura is an incredible source of information about CHSDM's constituents, and should be treated with white gloves, making sure that CHSDM and Smithsonian follow strict protocols. It's critical that CHSDM not only ensure the safety and privacy of its visitor's data, but that it also maintains the privacy agreement between CHSDM and our visitors.

Since Tessitura stores Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as a visitor’s address and phone number, this system is kept in a separate “zone” within the Smithsonian Network where every aspect of the network and servers within this zone are scrutinized and kept in compliance with [Payment Card Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) (PCI) standards.

Major aspects of CHSDM data are stored in entirely different physical locations, using entirely different system architectures.

All the data and logs about visitor's Pen activity are stored in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. This data is stored in MySQL databases, along with log files, which are stored in multiple locations and eventually processed with Logstash, which makes them neatly available to CHSDM in an ElasticSearch index, also built on AWS infrastructure. 

PII data generated by Tessitura is stored in the PCI compliant zone of the Smithsonian Data Center. This data is mostly stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database. 

How can CHSDM begin to make sense of all of this data if it’s in such a wide variety of forms, and living in such different physical locations? How can the museum connect activity with the Pen with its information about the visitors who are using the Pens? How can CHSDM develop an understanding about visitors who go to their websites after their visit, when that data is stored in Google Analytics and the Pen data and ticketing data is stored elsewhere? How much easier would all of this be if the data were 

stored all together and in one single format, allowing CHSDM to look at it all at once?
